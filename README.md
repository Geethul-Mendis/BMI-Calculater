This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented using Tkinter, a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python. Let's break down the code:

Importing Libraries:

import tkinter as tk: Imports the Tkinter library with an alias tk for easier reference.
from tkinter import messagebox: Imports the messagebox module from Tkinter for displaying message boxes.
Function Definition:

calculate_bmi(): This function is defined to calculate the BMI based on the weight and height provided by the user. It retrieves the values from the entry widgets (weight_entry and height_entry), calculates the BMI using the formula weight / (height * height), and then displays the result in a message box using messagebox.showinfo().
Creating the Main Window:

root = tk.Tk(): Creates the main window object.
root.title("BMI Calculator"): Sets the title of the window.
Creating Labels and Entry Widgets:

weight_label, height_label: Labels to indicate where the user should input weight and height respectively.
weight_entry, height_entry: Entry widgets where the user can input weight and height.
Creating Calculate Button:

calculate_button: Button widget labeled "Calculate BMI".
command=calculate_bmi: Specifies that when this button is clicked, the calculate_bmi() function will be called.
Grid Layout Management:

Widgets are organized using the grid layout manager (grid() method), specifying the row and column positions for each widget.
Running the Application:

root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, which listens for events (like button clicks, mouse movements) and handles them appropriately. This line keeps the GUI application running until the user closes the window.
Overall, this code creates a basic GUI for a BMI calculator, where users can input their weight and height, click a button to calculate their BMI, and see the result in a message box.
